# Eden-OS
Eden OS is a governance-oriented execution runtime for AI-native environments. It is not a traditional operating system, but a structural layer that separates agent behavior from deterministic world state evolution in multi-agent simulations.



Eden OS is structured around two interdependent architectural layers rather than multiple independent systems.
The public architecture separates behavioral execution from structural world governance, ensuring that agents remain expressive without gaining authority over simulation truth.
1. Actor Runtime — Behavioral Execution Layer
Actor Runtime defines how agents perceive, propose, and express outcomes.
It operates strictly above structural governance and does not participate in arbitration or world mutation.
Actors maintain:
fixed identity constraints
bounded knowledge scope
behavioral inertia
Language models act only as proposers and performers.
They never become sources of world authority.
2. Structural Governance Layer — SGK + WSL
The structural layer combines deterministic execution governance (SGK) with structural world stabilization (WSL).
Rather than acting as separate architectures, SGK and WSL form a unified execution boundary responsible for:
deterministic ordering of change
atomic world commits
structural pressure regulation
replayable state evolution
SGK governs how change is accepted.
WSL constrains how the world can evolve.
Together they ensure that independent subsystems interact without destabilizing shared reality.
🔹 Architectural Advantages
Eden OS introduces several systemic guarantees:
✔ Deterministic Decision Traceability
All approved outcomes pass through a governance boundary, allowing:
commit history inspection
replayable execution timelines
structural reasoning about world evolution
✔ Safe Rollback & Replay
Atomic commits and signal-driven evolution enable controlled rollback without corrupting behavioral layers.
✔ Separation of Expression from Authority
Agents remain expressive and adaptive while structural truth remains centralized.
✔ Stability Through Structural Signals
World evolution is regulated by aggregated pressures rather than narrative events, preventing uncontrolled state spikes.
✔ Domain-Agnostic Execution
The runtime remains independent from gameplay, narrative logic, or agent orchestration frameworks.
🔹 Architectural Relationship
Actor Runtime and the Structural Governance Layer are not parallel systems.
They represent two execution planes:


Behavior Plane   → Actor Runtime
Structural Plane → SGK + WSL
This separation allows Eden OS to scale multi-agent environments without granting agents control over shared world state.
